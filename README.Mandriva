There's not many steps you need to do. The setup is done in the
/etc/sysconfig/spybye file, for example if you want the proxy running on a
different port, then just change the 8181 value to something else as in:

SPYBYE_PORT="-p 8181"

Then just restart the service:

/etc/rc.d/init.d/spybye restart

Don't forget to change the proxy settings in your preffered web browser.

That's it.
